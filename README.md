# recommendationSystem
# For the edx education we have to build a movie recommendation system based on the 10M MovieLens dataset. As a deliverable we have
# to provide a code script, a RMarkdown file (.Rmd) and a PDF generated out of the RMardown file. The rating system will be "measured"
# based on a RMSE and there was a given RMSE-score to be undercut
